# Linkedin-Scraper

Scraping LinkedIn profiles is not fun(at all). Without signing-in with a LinkedIn account, you can hardly access more than 15 profiles.

 1. You need to sign-in with your account.
 2. LinkedIn profile pages are dynamic and don't load completely unless you scroll the entire page.

This program let's you scrape profiles based on a keyword in the user's title. (You can edit the link to look for profiles of users working at a specific company or studying at some school)
It generates a csv file of these profiles with columns:
 1. Months of Experience
 2. Skills (Seperated by ':')
 3. Recommendations received
 4. No. of Projects
 5. No. of Publications
 6. No. of Followers
